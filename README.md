## Notes (for myself more than anyone else, in case I forget!)
### Neovim 
Most of the setup was done by following through this beautiful video by [ThePrimagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).

The config isn't bootstrapped to install Packer plugins yet, so to get it running, source the packer.nvim file and then do a :PackerSync.
