# .dotfiles
Home to all my .dotfiles

## Notes (for myself more than anyone else, in case I forget!)

### Prequisite
1. [Ioveska Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/IosevkaTerm.zip)

### Neovim 
Most of the setup was done by following through this beautiful video by [ThePrimagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).

The config isn't bootstrapped to install Packer plugins yet, so to get it running, source the packer.nvim file and then do a :PackerSync.

To-do: Bootstrap the plugin setup.

### Picom 
The Picom config handles the transperancy and eliminates any type of screen-tearing(for me atleast!).

### .dotfiles Setup
Was setup with the help of gnu-stow & git.

If you want to learn how to manage your dotfiles too, then I recommend what I followed through myself for this exact [setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxAT1u8G7is).
